WISHLIST:
* Scan midi stream for pitch setting/changes
* Identify instruments from midi: especially drum and piano
* Support more drum elements like tom, ride, ...
* Adjust fill_bars to different time signature than 4/4
* Reorganize the timing in select_duration to better match the bars
* Recognize and set triplets. That's difficult though
* In some constellations (like unproperly placed 16th) following notes can get lost
* Automatic left/right hand split (aka bass/treble selection) for piano
